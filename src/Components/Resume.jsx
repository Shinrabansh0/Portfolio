                        My name is Tyler Felps, I'm a graduate from the University of Idaho with a major focus on Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I strive for success in my field and aim to continue growing my knowledge and experience in any role I take to better myself and my company. Working in a team environment is my preferred method for development to ensure every possible method has been discussed without too focused on a single solution. My career goals are stability in an employer and growth as an individual within the industry.
